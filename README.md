This project was inpired by renanxcortes's springerQuarantineBooksR(https://github.com/renanxcortes/springerQuarantineBooksR/)

## Usage
### Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook in the desired folder and run all cells. A "Springer Books" directory and subfolders categorizing the books according to its subject will be created.
### Python Script
Run the script in the desired folder using:
```
python springer.py
```
It'll function exactly as the jupyter notebook.

Your terminal or jupyter notebook cell output will show which book's being downloaded.
